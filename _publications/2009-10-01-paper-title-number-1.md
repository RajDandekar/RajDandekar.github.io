## Abstract
We have developed a globally applicable diagnostic COVID-19 model by augmenting the classical SIR epidemiological model with a neural network module. Our model does not rely upon previous epidemics like SARS/MERS and all parameters are optimized via machine learning algorithms used on publicly available COVID-19 data. The model decomposes the contributions to the infection time series to analyze and compare the role of quarantine control policies used in highly affected regions of Europe, North America, South America, and Asia in controlling the spread of the virus. For all continents considered, our results show a generally strong correlation between strengthening of the quarantine controls as learnt by the model and actions taken by the regions' respective governments. In addition, we have hosted our quarantine diagnosis results for the top 70 affected countries worldwide, on a public platform.
